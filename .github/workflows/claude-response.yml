          This GitHub Actions workflow is set up to respond to Claude mentions, but requires proper Claude Code API integration to function.
          
          For now, you can:
          1. Clone this repository locally
          2. Use Claude Code CLI to address the optimization requests
          3. Submit pull requests with the improvements
          
          Issue: #${issueNumber}
          Repository: ${context.repo.owner}/${context.repo.repo}`;
          
          github.rest.issues.createComment({
            issue_number: issueNumber,
            owner: context.repo.owner,
            repo: context.repo.repo,
            body: comment
          });
